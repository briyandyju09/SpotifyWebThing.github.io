# **Spotify Car Thing.. but its on the web.**

## **Find This Project Here:** https://ampersandco.me/SpotifyWebThing.github.io/

**Why does this even exist?:**

Did you even hear the news about the Spotify Car Thing? Apparently, it's hitting the road for good in December. Sad times! That little gadget had a surprisingly slick UI, paired with its handy media control knob. It was a bummer they never took it further.

That's why I'm building this web project! It's like a mini graveyard for the Car Thing's potential, keeping its awesome UI alive. We might not be blasting tunes through the car speakers just yet, but you can still browse your playlists and see the next song up, just like the good ol' Car Thing days. Think of it as a tribute to a fallen hero of in-car music control!

**How does this work?:**

Imagine a mini Spotify Car Thing on your computer, but instead of playing music, it shows your saved songs! This project brings that cool black and grey interface to life. You pop in a token (like a secret handshake), and it pulls up your saved songs. Click the arrows to flip through your playlist, just like the Car Thing. Can't blast tunes yet, but clicking the "Play" button lets you search for the song on YouTube to listen to it there automatically. It's a fun way to relive the Car Thing's vibe and browse your music collection on your computer!

**Token!? What Token??:**
Woah Woah! Chill out cuz getting your token is as easy as this!;

-   **Go to Spotify for Developers:** Open your internet browser and visit the Spotify for Developers website:  [https://developer.spotify.com/](https://developer.spotify.com/)
    
-   **Log in with Spotify:** In the top right corner, click on the "Log In" button. Use your regular Spotify account credentials (username and password) to log in.
    
-   **Create an App:** Once logged in, you'll land on your developer dashboard. Look for a button labeled "Create an App" and click on it.
    
-   **Name Your App:** A pop-up window will appear. Here, you need to give your temporary app a name. We recommend you name it something simple and quick as this wont matter!
    
-   **Describe Your App (Optional):** There's also a section for a short description. You can skip this for now by entering anything random.
    
-   **Accept the Terms:** Make sure the checkbox next to "I have read and agree to the Developer Terms of Service" is checked.
    
-   **Create the App:** Click the "Create" button. Congratulations! You've just created a temporary app on Spotify for Developers.
    
-   **Find Your Client ID:** Now you need to grab your Client ID. On the app overview page, look for a section titled "Client ID". This is a unique identifier for your app. Copy it somewhere safe, as you'll need it later.
    
-   **Find Your Client Secret:** You'll also need a Client Secret, which acts like a password for your app but since you wont be using this app for personal projects this wont matter as much! Click on the link that says "Show Client Secret". A pop-up will appear displaying the code. Copy this Client Secret and store it securely.
- **Getting Your Token:** Now insert this Client ID and Secret into this website: https://alecchen.dev/spotify-refresh-token and select all scopes to ensure you dont leave out any important requirements. Then after submitting be sure to copy the Access Token and not the Refresh Token.

**MAAANN I'm too lazy to do allat, Just give me a demo token for now:** Uhhh sure? Go ahead with my Client details!
